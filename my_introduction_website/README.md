This is a website to introduce myself to my g[62] cohort before class starts. My goals for this assignment were to:
- practice using flexbox for the layout of the elements.
- create an interactive way for the user to get to know me rather than reading a paragraph of text.
- play with CSS background effects for a more immersive way to display photos
